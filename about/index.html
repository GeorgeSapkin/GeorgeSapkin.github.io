With over 10 years of experience designing, implementing, testing and refactoring back-end solutions for several key players in the oil and gas industry in Norway and human resource, government and non-profit industries in the Netherlands, I’ve been recently trying a startup co-founder hat on for size.</p>
<p>Fluent in English, Russian, D and JavaScript. Well-versed in OOP design patterns and best industry standards and practices. Comfortable with C#, Java and Android development. Speaking C++ when nobody’s around. Capable of Python under pressure.</p>
<p>I did everything in .NET from WinForms, ASP.NET, MVC and ADO.NET to .NET CF, WCF Data Services, Workflow Services and Entity Framework. A bit of Java to glue all these to outside world and C++ when resources got tight back when Windows Mobile was still a thing.</p>
<p>In the past few years I switched to Linux and open source where I developed distributed back ends and communication layers with Node.js, vibe.d and a few NoSQL DBs. Recently delved into making Linux-based device firmwares, kernels and automated build chains.</p>
<p>I’m always looking for the next big challenge bringing disruptive ideas to life. Seeking to learn skills other than relentless coding while having fun. Interested in electronics, robotics, cats and business side of things. I’m an active team-player and a quick learner, willing to adapt to any situation. I enjoy teaching and learning new things from others. I live in sprints, unit-test my daily life and despise red tape. </p>
<p>Feel free to <a href="/contacts">contact me</a>, I’d love to hear from you!</p>
